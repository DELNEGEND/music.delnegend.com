00:00:25.632 --> 00:00:26.132
Yeah 

00:00:26.457 --> 00:00:29.109
In the studio,
I turn on the beat and rap all day.

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:31.805
The wine bottle,
one sip and I'm already drunk.

00:00:31.814 --> 00:00:34.031
Aimless thoughts,
thinking about you and the clouds.

00:00:34.354 --> 00:00:36.890
There's no need for wine,
cuz I've already drunk when looking at your photos.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.469
In the studio,
I'm still writing with this hand.

00:00:39.656 --> 00:00:42.250
My songs are nothing without loves.

00:00:42.671 --> 00:00:45.000
If they don't fit your taste,
then I need to recheck myself.

00:00:45.255 --> 00:00:47.255
If you were so fastidious,
then how can I flirt?

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.398
You didn't forget to post on Instagram.

00:00:50.534 --> 00:00:52.896
A glass of green tea sits beside you.

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.787
Wrote a caption, no rambling.

00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:58.454
You said you're very meek, no greedy.

00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.939
5000 hearts after 2 hours.

00:01:01.148 --> 00:01:03.844
Your followers must be young-boys.

00:01:03.975 --> 00:01:06.439
They follow you until the end,
but one thing they didn't know,

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:09.000
They're not your taste.

00:01:09.713 --> 00:01:11.104
Diamonds on your wrists.

00:01:12.503 --> 00:01:14.140
Expensive restaurants are
the only places you have meals.

00:01:15.104 --> 00:01:17.720
Your piercings are made from gold.

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:19.761
Your lipsticks must be genuine.

00:01:20.105 --> 00:01:22.496
But I don't have those things.

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:25.140
I only have a computer and a dog,

00:01:25.697 --> 00:01:27.844
alongside some unfinished demo.

00:01:28.485 --> 00:01:30.000
And every day I'd have to clean...

00:01:30.377 --> 00:01:32.928
In the studio, I turn on the beat and rap all-day.

00:01:33.345 --> 00:01:35.562
The wine bottle,
one sip and I'm already drunk.

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:38.035
Aimless thoughts,
thinking about you and the clouds.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.521
There's no need for wine,
cuz I've already drunk when looking at your photos.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.660
In the studio,
I'm still writing with this hand.

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:46.266
My songs are nothing without loves.

00:01:46.604 --> 00:01:48.792
If they don't fit your taste,
then I need to recheck myself.

00:01:49.205 --> 00:01:51.698
If you were so fastidious,
then how can I flirt?

00:02:13.187 --> 00:02:15.810
Book a place at a luxury restaurant,
in the center of district One.

00:02:16.015 --> 00:02:18.305
Sit on the chair and then
I dream about perfect love.

00:02:18.611 --> 00:02:20.872
The first date is important,
I must be at my best.

00:02:21.188 --> 00:02:22.482
But she looked at my outfit,

00:02:22.482 --> 00:02:24.000
and said she didn't like it.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.559
Tom Ford on your lips.
(A luxury fashion-brand)

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:29.297
Comfort on my shoulder.
(A name of a comforter)

00:02:29.297 --> 00:02:31.912
Raptor Ford on the road with you inside.

00:02:31.912 --> 00:02:34.463
But today, I came to you with none of them.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.057
I must work from morning till night.

00:02:37.515 --> 00:02:39.464
No time to rest.

00:02:40.167 --> 00:02:42.412
And you went to bars and clubs
from night till morning.

00:02:42.714 --> 00:02:44.903
Is that the way you relax?

00:02:45.343 --> 00:02:47.914
If I don't work then who'll feed me?

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:50.667
I started working since I was 20.

00:02:50.757 --> 00:02:53.293
You don't need to work
cuz you have rich men.

00:02:53.348 --> 00:02:56.061
You just need to choose
who'll beside you tonight!

00:02:56.127 --> 00:02:58.495
If I don't work then who'll feed me?

00:02:58.597 --> 00:03:01.133
I started working since I was 20.

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:03.815
You don't need to work
cuz you have rich men.

00:03:03.924 --> 00:03:06.399
You just need to choose
who'll beside you tonight!

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:07.716
Baby baby

00:03:07.716 --> 00:03:08.893
Someone's calling you.

00:03:08.893 --> 00:03:10.188
Daddy daddy

00:03:10.188 --> 00:03:11.661
Is calling you.

00:03:11.722 --> 00:03:13.010
Check it, check it.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.418
(What are you worried about?)

00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:15.511
Just next, just next.

00:03:15.511 --> 00:03:17.056
(Why are you worried about it?)

00:03:17.246 --> 00:03:19.709
You could just leave without worrying.

00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:22.390
You with your new-lover showed on (Facebook/Insta) Story.

00:03:22.682 --> 00:03:25.217
You're making my life harder, more headaches.

00:03:25.376 --> 00:03:28.231
Cuz you only taking, not giving.

00:03:34.288 --> 00:03:36.752
Cuz you only taking, not giving.
